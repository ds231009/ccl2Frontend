# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Day Nr. 1 - 08.06.2025
            - ✅ What I worked on today: Setting up git for front and backend and connecting both.
            - 💡 Biggest learning: Saving Tokens is kinda important :/ 
            - ❌ Biggest mistake/blocker: Copying package.json with authors from SSC etc.
            - 📌 Notes for tomorrow: Setting up database and connecting it to backend to see if it fits. And creating more detailed project scope.
